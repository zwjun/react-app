### Install and Initialization

We need to install the appropriate tools first, you may need install [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/) too.

```bash
$ npm install -g yarn
```

Then we go inside react-app and start it.

use yarn

```bash
$ cd react-app
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```
or use npm

```bash
$ cd react-app
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Open browser at http://localhost:3000/, it renders a header saying "Welcome to React" on the page.
